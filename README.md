# Skriptilation

This is a repository that'll hold all the scripts I've made and publicly released, aswell as current projects of mine that I'm working on.
Regarding the projects that I'm working on, I cannot guarantee that they'll work right off the bat! Never put my in-development scripts on a server for the public instead of a test server, because it'll probably break some stuff.

You'll be able to tell what scripts are in development because they'll be in a separate folder labeled "indev", scripts that are good to go will be in a folder labeled "done". I have yet to put this organization into place though.
